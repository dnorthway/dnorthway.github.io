    <h1>How to Seamlessly Integrate Excel Spreadsheets with ProjectProdigy</h1>

    <p>Welcome to our tutorial on harnessing the power of ProjectProdigy to streamline your project management using Excel spreadsheets. Follow these steps to make your workflow more efficient:</p>

    <h2>Step 1: Adding Excel Spreadsheets to Your Project Template</h2>
    <p>If you use other Excel spreadsheets in your projects, you can easily add them to your project template:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Locate the Excel file you want to integrate, for example, an Excel pay application form.</li>
        <li>Save it as a .xlsx file if it's not already in this format.</li>
        <li>Open your project template in ProjectProdigy.</li>
        <li>Add sheets or copy and paste data from the Excel file directly into the template.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step 2: Extracting Formulas from Proposal Sheets</h2>
    <p>If you have your own proposal or summary sheet, you can easily extract and use formulas from the proposal sheet:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Locate the proposal sheet within your project template.</li>
        <li>Extract the formulas you need for your own sheet.</li>
        <li>Simply paste these formulas into your custom sheet in the template.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step 3: Unprotecting the Proposal Sheet</h2>
    <p>For seamless customization, you can unprotect the proposal sheet on your desktop:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Access the proposal sheet in your project template.</li>
        <li>Remove any protection settings as needed.</li>
        <li>This allows you to make changes and adjustments to suit your specific project requirements.</li>
    </ul>
